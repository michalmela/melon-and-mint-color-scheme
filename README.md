# melon-and-mint-color-scheme

A high contrast, pitch-black background, red-color-used-only-for-things-that-are-errors-and-problems (unlike some other extremely popular color schemes) color scheme. Only for cool people.

## General remarks

Probably works well with any font but I personally recommend https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode .

## IDEA

Goes well with the "Darcula Pitch Black" IDE skin.
